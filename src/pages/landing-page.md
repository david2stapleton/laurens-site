    body: Coloratura soprano Lauren Sutherland wins over audiences with her energetic stage presence and her glittering high notes. During the 24/25 season, Lauren made her role debut as Phyllis in Iolanthe with the Savoyaires, where she was hailed by the Chicago Theatre Review as "graceful, charming and sang like a bird." In the summer of 2025, Lauren performed excerpts of Lucia from Lucia di Lammermoor with Fox Valley Opera and as Verveine in the Chicago premiere of Pauline Viardot’s Le Dernier Sorcier with Bellissima Opera.
