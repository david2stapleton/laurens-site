      Lauren teaches voice in the Oak Park/Chicago area to students of all ages. She enjoys teaching pop, jazz, and classical vocal techniques to students starting from age 9. These lessons include lessons in sight singing, ear training, basic piano, and music theory.

             In her lessons with adult students, Lauren focuses on developing confidence in singing and the student's individual goals of exploring repertoire, singing harmony, expanding range, and learning how to read music, among other techniques.

             Lauren is available for one on one audition consultations on a by-needed basis, and can assist in coaching monologues and selecting audition cuts.

             Lauren teaches online students from across America and in-person students in the Oak Park/Chicago area. Lauren specializes in at-home lessons in the student's home for your convenience!

             20 min initial consultations are free of charge, and all inquiries can be directed to Lauren at sutherland.lauren.m@gmail.com.
